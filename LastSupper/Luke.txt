022:007 The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
022:008 He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."
022:009 They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
022:010 He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.
022:011 Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
022:012 He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."
022:013 They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
022:014 When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
022:015 He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
022:016 for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."
022:017 He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,
022:018 for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes."
022:019 He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."
022:020 Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
022:021 But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
022:022 The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
022:023 They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
022:024 There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
022:025 He said to them, "The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'
022:026 But not so with you.  But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.
022:027 For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it he who sits at the table?  But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.
022:028 But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
022:029 I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,
022:030 that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
022:031 The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,
022:032 but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers."
022:033 He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!"
022:034 He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times."
022:035 He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?"  They said, "Nothing."
022:036 Then he said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet.  Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
022:037 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me:  'He was counted with the lawless.' For that which concerns me has an end."
022:038 They said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords."  He said to them, "That is enough."
022:039 He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
