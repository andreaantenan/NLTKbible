026:017 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
026:018 He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand.  I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
026:019 The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
026:020 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
026:021 As they were eating, he said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
026:022 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn't me, is it, Lord?"
026:023 He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
026:024 The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
026:025 Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?"  He said to him, "You said it."
026:026 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
026:027 He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it,
026:028 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.
026:029 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom."
026:030 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
