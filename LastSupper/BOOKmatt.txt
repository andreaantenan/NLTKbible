Book 40 Matthew
001:001 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
001:002 Abraham became the father of Isaac.  Isaac became the father of Jacob.  Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.
001:003 Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron.  Hezron became the father of Ram.
001:004 Ram became the father of Amminadab.  Amminadab became the father of Nahshon.  Nahshon became the father of Salmon.
001:005 Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab.  Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth.  Obed became the father of Jesse.
001:006 Jesse became the father of David the king.  David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
001:007 Solomon became the father of Rehoboam.  Rehoboam became the father of Abijah.  Abijah became the father of Asa.
001:008 Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat.  Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram.  Joram became the father of Uzziah.
001:009 Uzziah became the father of Jotham.  Jotham became the father of Ahaz.  Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.
001:010 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh.  Manasseh became the father of Amon.  Amon became the father of Josiah.
001:011 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.
001:012 After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
001:013 Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud.  Abiud became the father of Eliakim.  Eliakim became the father of Azor.
001:014 Azor became the father of Sadoc.  Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
001:015 Eliud became the father of Eleazar.  Eleazar became the father of Matthan.  Matthan became the father of Jacob.
001:016 Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.
001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
001:019 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
001:020 But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
001:021 She shall bring forth a son.  You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."
001:022 Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
001:023 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;" which is, being interpreted, "God with us."
001:024 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
001:025 and didn't know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son.  He named him Jesus.
002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
002:002 "Where is he who is born King of the Jews?  For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
002:003 When Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
002:004 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.
002:005 They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,
002:006 'You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among the princes of Judah:  for out of you shall come forth a governor, who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"
002:007 Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
002:008 He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child.  When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."
002:009 They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
002:011 They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
002:012 Being warned in a dream that they shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.
002:013 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
002:014 He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
002:015 and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.
002:017 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
002:018 "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; she wouldn't be comforted, because they are no more."
002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
002:020 "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."
002:021 He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,
002:023 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."
003:001 In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
003:002 "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
003:003 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord.  Make his paths straight."
003:004 Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist.  His food was locusts and wild honey.
003:005 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.
003:006 They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
003:008 Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
003:009 Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
003:010 "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
003:011 I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry.  He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
003:012 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor.  He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
003:013 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
003:014 But John would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
003:015 But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.
003:016 Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him.  He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
003:017 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
004:001 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
004:002 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
004:003 The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
004:004 But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
004:005 Then the devil took him into the holy city.  He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
004:006 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge concerning you.' and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'"
004:007 Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Lord, your God.'"
004:008 Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
004:009 He said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."
004:010 Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan!  For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'"
004:011 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
004:012 Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.
004:013 Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
004:014 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
004:015 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
004:016 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light has dawned."
004:017 From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent!  For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
004:018 Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers:  Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
004:019 He said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men."
004:020 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
004:021 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets.  He called them.
004:022 They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
004:023 Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
004:024 The report about him went out into all Syria.  They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
004:025 Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
005:001 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
005:002 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
005:003 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:004 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
005:005 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
005:006 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
005:007 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
005:010 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:011 "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
005:012 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
005:013 "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted?  It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.
005:014 You are the light of the world.  A city located on a hill can't be hidden.
005:015 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
005:016 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
005:017 "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.
005:018 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.
005:019 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:020 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:021 "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'
005:022 But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
005:023 "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
005:024 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
005:025 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
005:026 Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.
005:027 "You have heard that it was said,  'You shall not commit adultery;'
005:028 but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
005:029 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you.  For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
005:030 If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you.  For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
005:031 "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'
005:032 but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
005:033 "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,'
005:034 but I tell you, don't swear at all:  neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
005:035 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
005:036 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.
005:037 But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
005:038 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
005:039 But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
005:040 If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.
005:041 Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
005:042 Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you.
005:043 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'
005:044 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
005:045 that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
005:046 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
005:047 If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
005:048 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
006:001 "Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
006:002 Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
006:003 But when you do merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand does,
006:004 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
006:005 "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
006:006 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
006:007 In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
006:008 Therefore don't be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.
006:009 Pray like this:  'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.
006:010 Let your Kingdom come.  Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
006:011 Give us today our daily bread.
006:012 Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
006:013 Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.'
006:014 "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
006:015 But if you don't forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
006:016 "Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces.  For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting.  Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
006:017 But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
006:018 so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
006:019 "Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
006:020 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal;
006:021 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
006:022 "The lamp of the body is the eye.  If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
006:023 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
006:024 "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other.  You can't serve both God and Mammon.
006:025 Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear.  Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
006:026 See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns.  Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?
006:027 "Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?
006:028 Why are you anxious about clothing?  Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.  They don't toil, neither do they spin,
006:029 yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
006:030 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
006:031 "Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'
006:032 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
006:033 But seek first God's Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
006:034 Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.  Each day's own evil is sufficient.
007:001 "Don't judge, so that you won't be judged.
007:002 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
007:003 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
007:004 Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
007:005 You hypocrite!  First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.
007:006 "Don't give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
007:007 "Ask, and it will be given you.  Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.
007:008 For everyone who asks receives.  He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
007:009 Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
007:010 Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
007:011 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
007:012 Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
007:013 "Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.
007:014 How narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.
007:015 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
007:016 By their fruits you will know them.  Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
007:017 Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.
007:018 A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
007:019 Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.
007:020 Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.
007:021 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
007:022 Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'
007:023 Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you.  Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'
007:024 "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.
007:025 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock.
007:026 Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.
007:027 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."
007:028 It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
007:029 for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.
008:001 When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
008:002 Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
008:003 Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean."  Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
008:004 Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
008:005 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,
008:006 and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."
008:007 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
008:008 The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof.  Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
008:009 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
008:011 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
008:012 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness.  There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
008:013 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way.  Let it be done for you as you have believed."  His servant was healed in that hour.
008:014 When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.
008:015 He touched her hand, and the fever left her.  She got up and served him.
008:016 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
008:017 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:  "He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."
008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
008:019 A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
008:020 Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
008:021 Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
008:022 But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
008:023 When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
008:024 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.
008:025 They came to him, and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!"
008:026 He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
008:027 The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
008:028 When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
008:029 Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God?  Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
008:030 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
008:031 The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."
008:032 He said to them, "Go!"  They came out, and went into the herd of pigs:  and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
008:033 Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
008:034 Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus.  When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
009:001 He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
009:002 Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."
009:003 Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man blasphemes."
009:004 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
009:005 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'
009:006 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then he said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."
009:007 He arose and departed to his house.
009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
009:009 As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.  He said to him, "Follow me." He got up and followed him.
009:010 It happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
009:011 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
009:012 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
009:013 But you go and learn what this means:  'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
009:014 Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
009:015 Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?  But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
009:016 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
009:017 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined.  No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
009:018 While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
009:019 Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
009:020 Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
009:021 for she said within herself, "If I just touch his garment, I will be made well."
009:022 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well."  And the woman was made well from that hour.
009:023 When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
009:024 he said to them, "Make room, because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping."  They were ridiculing him.
009:025 But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
009:026 The report of this went out into all that land.
009:027 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!"
009:028 When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They told him, "Yes, Lord."
009:029 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."
009:030 Their eyes were opened.  Jesus strictly charged them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."
009:031 But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
009:032 As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.
009:033 When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
009:034 But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons."
009:035 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
009:037 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
009:038 Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest."
010:001 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
010:003 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
010:004 Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
010:005 Jesus sent these twelve out, and charged them, saying, "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city of the Samaritans.
010:006 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
010:007 As you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons.  Freely you received, so freely give.
010:009 Don't take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.
010:010 Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff:  for the laborer is worthy of his food.
010:011 Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.
010:012 As you enter into the household, greet it.
010:013 If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn't worthy, let your peace return to you.
010:014 Whoever doesn't receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
010:015 Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
010:016 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
010:017 But beware of men:  for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
010:018 Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
010:019 But when they deliver you up, don't be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.
010:020 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
010:021 "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
010:022 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.
010:024 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord.  If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
010:026 Therefore don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.
010:027 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
010:028 Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.  Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
010:029 "Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,
010:030 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
010:031 Therefore don't be afraid.  You are of more value than many sparrows.
010:032 Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
010:033 But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
010:034 "Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn't come to send peace, but a sword.
010:035 For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
010:036 A man's foes will be those of his own household.
010:037 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me.
010:038 He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.
010:039 He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
010:040 He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
010:041 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward:  and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.
010:042 Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."
011:001 It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
011:002 Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
011:003 and said to him, "Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?"
011:004 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
011:005 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
011:006 Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me."
011:007 As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
011:008 But what did you go out to see?  A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
011:009 But why did you go out?  To see a prophet?  Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
011:011 Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
011:012 From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
011:014 If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
011:015 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011:016 "But to what shall I compare this generation?  It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
011:017 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance. We mourned for you, and you didn't lament.'
011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
011:019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'  But wisdom is justified by her children."
011:020 Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn't repent.
011:021 "Woe to you, Chorazin!  Woe to you, Bethsaida!  For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
011:022 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
011:023 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
011:024 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."
011:025 At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.
011:026 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
011:027 All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him.
011:028 "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.
011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
012:001 At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
012:002 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
012:003 But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
012:004 how he entered into the house of God, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
012:005 Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
012:006 But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
012:007 But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
012:008 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
012:009 He departed there, and went into their synagogue.
012:010 And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" that they might accuse him.
012:011 He said to them, "What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't he grab on to it, and lift it out?
012:012 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day."
012:013 Then he told the man, "Stretch out your hand."  He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
012:014 But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.
012:015 Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there.  Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
012:016 and charged them that they should not make him known:
012:017 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
012:018 "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:  I will put my Spirit on him. He will proclaim justice to the nations.
012:019 He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
012:020 He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a smoking flax, until he leads justice to victory.
012:021 In his name, the nations will hope."
012:022 Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
012:023 All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be the son of David?"
012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
012:025 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
012:026 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
012:027 If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out?  Therefore they will be your judges.
012:028 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
012:029 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.
012:030 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn't gather with me, scatters.
012:031 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.
012:032 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
012:033 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
012:034 You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
012:035 The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things.
012:036 I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
012:037 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
012:038 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
012:039 But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
012:040 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
012:041 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
012:042 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.
012:043 But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn't find it.
012:044 Then he says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,' and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.
012:045 Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation."
012:046 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
012:047 One said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."
012:048 But he answered him who spoke to him, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
012:049 He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
012:050 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother."
013:001 On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
013:002 Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
013:003 He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer went out to sow.
013:004 As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
013:005 Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.
013:006 When the sun had risen, they were scorched.  Because they had no root, they withered away.
013:007 Others fell among thorns.  The thorns grew up and choked them:
013:008 and others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
013:009 He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
013:010 The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
013:011 He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
013:012 For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.
013:013 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.
013:014 In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, 'By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive:
013:015 for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and should turn again; and I would heal them.'
013:016 "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
013:017 For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.
013:018 "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
013:019 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.  This is what was sown by the roadside.
013:020 What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
013:021 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
013:022 What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
013:023 What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
013:024 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,
013:025 but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.
013:026 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.
013:027 The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field?  Where did this darnel come from?'
013:028 "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'  "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
013:029 "But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"
013:031 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
013:032 which indeed is smaller than all seeds.  But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."
013:033 He spoke another parable to them.  "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."
013:034 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't speak to them,
013:035 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."
013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field."
013:037 He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
013:038 the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.
013:039 The enemy who sowed them is the devil.  The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
013:040 As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.
013:041 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,
013:042 and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
013:043 Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father.  He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
013:044 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid.  In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
013:045 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,
013:046 who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
013:047 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
013:048 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.
013:049 So will it be in the end of the world.  The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
013:050 and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
013:051 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
013:052 He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things."
013:053 It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.
013:054 Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
013:055 Isn't this the carpenter's son?  Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
013:056 Aren't all of his sisters with us?  Where then did this man get all of these things?"
013:057 They were offended by him.  But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."
013:058 He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
014:001 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
014:002 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead.  That is why these powers work in him."
014:003 For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
014:004 For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
014:005 When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
014:006 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.
014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
014:008 She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer."
014:009 The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,
014:010 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
014:011 His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.
014:012 His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.
014:013 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart.  When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
014:014 Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude.  He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
014:015 When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
014:016 But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
014:017 They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."
014:018 He said, "Bring them here to me."
014:019 He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
014:020 They all ate, and were filled.  They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
014:021 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
014:022 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
014:023 After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray.  When evening had come, he was there alone.
014:024 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
014:025 In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
014:026 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.
014:027 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."
014:028 Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
014:029 He said, "Come!"  Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.
014:030 But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
014:031 Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
014:032 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
014:033 Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"
014:034 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
014:035 When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,
014:036 and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment.  As many as touched it were made whole.
015:001 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
015:002 "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."
015:003 He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
015:004 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
015:005 But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"
015:006 he shall not honor his father or mother.'  You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
015:007 You hypocrites!  Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
015:008 'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
015:009 And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'"
015:010 He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.
015:011 That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
015:012 Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
015:013 But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted.
015:014 Leave them alone.  They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
015:015 Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."
015:016 So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?
015:017 Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
015:018 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
015:019 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
015:020 These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the man."
015:021 Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
015:022 Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David!  My daughter is severely demonized!"
015:023 But he answered her not a word.  His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."
015:024 But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
015:025 But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."
015:026 But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
015:027 But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
015:028 Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire."  And her daughter was healed from that hour.
015:029 Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
015:030 Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
015:031 so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel.
015:032 Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat.  I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."
015:033 The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
015:034 Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
015:035 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
015:036 and he took the seven loaves and the fish.  He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
015:037 They all ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
015:038 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
015:039 Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
016:001 The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
016:002 But he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
016:003 In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.'  Hypocrites!  You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times!
016:004 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah." He left them, and departed.
016:005 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
016:006 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
016:007 They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
016:008 Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
016:009 Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
016:010 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
016:011 How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread?  But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
016:012 Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
016:013 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
016:014 They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
016:015 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
016:016 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
016:017 Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
016:018 I also tell you that you are Peter, I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
016:019 I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
016:020 Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ.
016:021 From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
016:022 Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord!  This will never be done to you."
016:023 But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan!  You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
016:024 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
016:025 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.
016:026 For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life?  Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
016:027 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.
016:028 Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
017:001 After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
017:002 He was transfigured before them.  His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
017:003 Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
017:004 Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here.  If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
017:005 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them.  Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
017:006 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
017:007 Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
017:008 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
017:009 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
017:010 His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
017:011 Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
017:012 but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them."
017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
017:014 When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,
017:015 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
017:016 So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."
017:017 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you?  How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."
017:018 Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
017:019 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why weren't we able to cast it out?"
017:020 He said to them, "Because of your unbelief.  For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
017:021 But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."
017:022 While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
017:023 and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up." They were exceedingly sorry.
017:024 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?"
017:025 He said, "Yes." When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon?  From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute?  From their children, or from strangers?"
017:026 Peter said to him, "From strangers."  Jesus said to him, "Therefore the children are exempt.
017:027 But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."
018:001 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
018:002 Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,
018:003 and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
018:004 Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
018:005 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
018:006 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.
018:007 "Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!
018:008 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you.  It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
018:009 If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you.  It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
018:010 See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
018:011 For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
018:012 "What do you think?  If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
018:013 If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
018:015 "If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone.  If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.
018:016 But if he doesn't listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
018:017 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.
018:018 Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
018:019 Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."
018:021 Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"
018:022 Jesus said to him, "I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
018:023 Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.
018:024 When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
018:025 But because he couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
018:026 The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'
018:027 The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
018:028 "But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
018:029 "So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!'
018:030 He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.
018:031 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
018:032 Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
018:033 Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'
018:034 His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.
018:035 So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds."
019:001 It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
019:002 Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
019:003 Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
019:004 He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,
019:005 and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?'
019:006 So that they are no more two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear apart."
019:007 They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?"
019:008 He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.
019:009 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery."
019:010 His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
019:011 But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
019:012 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.  He who is able to receive it, let him receive it."
019:013 Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
019:014 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."
019:015 He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.
019:016 Behold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
019:017 He said to him, "Why do you call me good?  No one is good but one, that is, God.  But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
019:018 He said to him, "Which ones?"  Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.'  'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'
019:019 'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
019:020 The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed from my youth.  What do I still lack?"
019:021 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
019:022 But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.
019:023 Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
019:024 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
019:025 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
019:026 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
019:027 Then Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and followed you.  What then will we have?"
019:028 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
019:029 Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
019:030 But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.
020:001 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
020:002 When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
020:003 He went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
020:004 To them he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.'  So they went their way.
020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
020:006 About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle.  He said to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'
020:007 "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' "He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.'
020:008 When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'
020:009 "When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.
020:010 When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.
020:011 When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
020:012 saying, 'These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'
020:013 "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
020:014 Take that which is yours, and go your way.  It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
020:015 Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'
020:016 So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen."
020:017 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
020:018 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
020:019 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."
020:020 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.
020:021 He said to her, "What do you want?"  She said to him, "Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."
020:022 But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to him, "We are able."
020:023 He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
020:024 When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
020:025 But Jesus summoned them, and said, "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
020:026 It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
020:027 Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,
020:028 even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
020:029 As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
020:030 Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
020:031 The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
020:032 Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"
020:033 They told him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
020:034 Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.
021:001 When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
021:002 saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.
021:003 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and immediately he will send them."
021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
021:005 "Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, your King comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
021:006 The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
021:007 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.
021:008 A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
021:009 The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, "Hosanna to the son of David!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!  Hosanna in the highest!"
021:010 When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
021:011 The multitudes said, "This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
021:012 Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
021:013 He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!"
021:014 The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
021:015 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David!" they were indignant,
021:016 and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"
021:017 He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
021:018 Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
021:019 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves.  He said to it, "Let there be no fruit from you forever!"  Immediately the fig tree withered away.
021:020 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"
021:021 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done.
021:022 All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
021:023 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
021:024 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
021:025 The baptism of John, where was it from?  From heaven or from men?" They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
021:026 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet."
021:027 They answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
021:028 But what do you think?  A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
021:029 He answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind, and went.
021:030 He came to the second, and said the same thing.  He answered, 'I go, sir,' but he didn't go.
021:031 Which of the two did the will of his father?"  They said to him, "The first."  Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you.
021:032 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him.  When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward, that you might believe him.
021:033 "Hear another parable.  There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.
021:034 When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
021:035 The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
021:037 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
021:038 But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir.  Come, let's kill him, and seize his inheritance.'
021:039 So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
021:040 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"
021:041 They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season."
021:042 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.  This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?'
021:043 "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
021:044 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."
021:045 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
021:046 When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.
022:001 Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
022:002 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
022:003 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
022:004 Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'
022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,
022:006 and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
022:007 When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
022:008 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy.
022:009 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'
022:010 Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.
022:011 But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,
022:012 and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?'  He was speechless.
022:013 Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'
022:014 For many are called, but few chosen."
022:015 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.
022:016 They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone.
022:017 Tell us therefore, what do you think?  Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
022:019 Show me the tax money."  They brought to him a denarius.
022:020 He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
022:021 They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
022:022 When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.
022:023 On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him.  They asked him,
022:024 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'
022:025 Now there were with us seven brothers.  The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.
022:026 In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
022:027 After them all, the woman died.
022:028 In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her."
022:029 But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.
022:031 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
022:032 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
022:033 When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
022:034 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
022:035 One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.
022:036 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
022:037 Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
022:038 This is the first and great commandment.
022:039 A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
022:040 The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."
022:041 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
022:042 saying, "What do you think of the Christ?  Whose son is he?" They said to him, "Of David."
022:043 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
022:044 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'
022:045 "If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
022:046 No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth.
023:001 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
023:002 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
023:003 All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don't do their works; for they say, and don't do.
023:004 For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.
023:005 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,
023:006 and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
023:007 the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men.
023:008 But don't you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.
023:009 Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.
023:010 Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.
023:011 But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.
023:012 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
023:013 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
023:014 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don't enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.
023:015 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
023:016 "Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'
023:017 You blind fools!  For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
023:018 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?'
023:019 You blind fools!  For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
023:020 He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.
023:021 He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was living in it.
023:022 He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.
023:023 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law:  justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
023:024 You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
023:025 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
023:026 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of it may become clean also.
023:027 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
023:028 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
023:029 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
023:030 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
023:031 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
023:032 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
023:033 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?
023:034 Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
023:035 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
023:036 Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.
023:037 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!  How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
023:038 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
023:039 For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
024:001 Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
024:002 But he answered them, "Don't you see all of these things? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down."
024:003 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
024:004 Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
024:005 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will lead many astray.
024:006 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars.  See that you aren't troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.
024:007 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
024:008 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
024:009 Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake.
024:010 Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.
024:011 Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
024:012 Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.
024:013 But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
024:014 This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
024:015 "When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
024:016 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
024:017 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house.
024:018 Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.
024:019 But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!
024:020 Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,
024:021 for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
024:022 Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
024:023 "Then if any man tells you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or, 'There,' don't believe it.
024:024 For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
024:025 "Behold, I have told you beforehand.
024:026 If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,' don't go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,' don't believe it.
024:027 For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:028 For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.
024:029 But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
024:030 and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
024:031 He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
024:032 "Now from the fig tree learn this parable.  When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
024:033 Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
024:034 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.
024:035 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
024:036 But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
024:037 "As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:038 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
024:039 and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:040 Then two men will be in the field:  one will be taken and one will be left;
024:041 two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.
024:042 Watch therefore, for you don't know in what hour your Lord comes.
024:043 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
024:044 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don't expect, the Son of Man will come.
024:045 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
024:046 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.
024:047 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.
024:048 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My lord is delaying his coming,'
024:049 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,
024:050 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn't expect it, and in an hour when he doesn't know it,
024:051 and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.  There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.
025:001 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
025:002 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
025:003 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
025:004 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
025:005 Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
025:006 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold!  The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!'
025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
025:008 The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
025:009 But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there isn't enough for us and you?  You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'
025:010 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
025:011 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'
025:012 But he answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.'
025:013 Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
025:014 "For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.
025:015 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability.  Then he went on his journey.
025:016 Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
025:017 In like manner he also who got the two gained another two.
025:018 But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
025:019 "Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.
025:020 He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.'
025:021 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things.  Enter into the joy of your lord.'
025:022 "He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents.  Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.'
025:023 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things.  Enter into the joy of your lord.'
025:024 "He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
025:025 I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'
025:026 "But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter.
025:027 You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.
025:028 Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
025:029 For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away.
025:030 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
025:031 "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
025:032 Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
025:033 He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
025:034 Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
025:035 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;
025:036 naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.'
025:037 "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
025:038 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
025:039 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
025:040 "The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
025:041 Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;
025:042 for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
025:043 I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'
025:044 "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?'
025:045 "Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.'
025:046 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
026:001 It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,
026:002 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
026:003 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
026:004 They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.
026:005 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."
026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
026:007 a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
026:008 But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
026:010 However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman?  Because she has done a good work for me.
026:011 For you always have the poor with you; but you don't always have me.
026:012 For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
026:013 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her."
026:014 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
026:015 and said, "What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?"  They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
026:016 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
026:017 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
026:018 He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand.  I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
026:019 The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
026:020 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
026:021 As they were eating, he said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
026:022 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn't me, is it, Lord?"
026:023 He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
026:024 The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
026:025 Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?"  He said to him, "You said it."
026:026 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
026:027 He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it,
026:028 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.
026:029 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom."
026:030 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
026:031 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
026:032 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
026:033 But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
026:034 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
026:035 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you."  All of the disciples also said likewise.
026:036 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
026:037 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
026:038 Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.  Stay here, and watch with me."
026:039 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
026:040 He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
026:041 Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
026:042 Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done."
026:043 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
026:044 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
026:045 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest.  Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
026:046 Arise, let's be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
026:047 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.
026:048 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one.  Seize him."
026:049 Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
026:050 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?"  Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
026:051 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
026:052 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
026:053 Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
026:054 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
026:055 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
026:056 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."  Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
026:057 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
026:058 But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.
026:059 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
026:060 and they found none.  Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none.  But at last two false witnesses came forward,
026:061 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
026:062 The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"
026:063 But Jesus held his peace.  The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
026:064 Jesus said to him, "You have said it.  Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
026:065 Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy!  Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
026:066 What do you think?"  They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
026:067 Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,
026:068 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ!  Who hit you?"
026:069 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
026:070 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you are talking about."
026:071 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
026:072 Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."
026:073 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."
026:074 Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!" Immediately the rooster crowed.
026:075 Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
027:001 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
027:002 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
027:003 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
027:004 saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us?  You see to it."
027:005 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.
027:006 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
027:007 They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.
027:008 Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
027:009 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,
027:010 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
027:011 Now Jesus stood before the governor:  and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  Jesus said to him, "So you say."
027:012 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
027:013 Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?"
027:014 He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
027:015 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
027:016 They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
027:017 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you?  Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"
027:018 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
027:019 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
027:020 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
027:021 But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"  They said, "Barabbas!"
027:022 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?"  They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
027:023 But the governor said, "Why?  What evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"
027:024 So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."
027:025 All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"
027:026 Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.
027:027 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.
027:028 They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
027:029 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
027:030 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
027:031 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
027:032 As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.
027:033 They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."
027:034 They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
027:035 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
027:036 and they sat and watched him there.
027:037 They set up over his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
027:038 Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
027:039 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
027:040 and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself!  If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
027:041 Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,
027:042 "He saved others, but he can't save himself.  If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
027:043 He trusts in God.  Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
027:044 The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
027:046 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
027:047 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."
027:048 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
027:049 The rest said, "Let him be.  Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."
027:050 Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
027:051 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.  The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
027:052 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
027:053 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
027:054 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."
027:055 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
027:056 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
027:057 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.
027:058 This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.  Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
027:059 Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
027:060 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
027:061 Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
027:062 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
027:063 saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive:  'After three days I will rise again.'
027:064 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
027:065 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard.  Go, make it as secure as you can."
027:066 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
028:001 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
028:002 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
028:003 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
028:004 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
028:005 The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
028:006 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
028:007 Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.'  Behold, I have told you."
028:008 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
028:009 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"  They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
028:010 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid.  Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
028:011 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
028:012 When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
028:013 saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
028:014 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."
028:015 So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.
028:016 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
028:017 When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
028:018 Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
028:019 Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
028:020 teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."  Amen.
