006:025 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
006:026 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
006:027 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him."
006:028 They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"
006:029 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
006:030 They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you?  What work do you do?
006:031 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.  As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"
006:032 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
006:033 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
006:034 They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
006:035 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.  He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
006:036 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
006:037 All those who the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
006:038 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
006:039 This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
006:040 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
006:041 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
006:042 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?  How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
006:043 Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
006:044 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
006:045 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.
006:046 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.
006:047 Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
006:048 I am the bread of life.
006:049 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
006:050 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
006:051 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
006:052 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
006:053 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don't have life in yourselves.
006:054 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
006:055 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
006:056 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.
006:057 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.
006:058 This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna, and died.  He who eats this bread will live forever."
006:059 These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
