014:012 On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"
014:013 He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,
014:014 and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
014:015 He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there."
014:016 His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.
014:017 When it was evening he came with the twelve.
014:018 As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me."
014:019 They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, "Surely not I?"  And another said, "Surely not I?"
014:020 He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.
014:021 For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
014:022 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body."
014:023 He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.
014:024 He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
014:025 Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God."
014:026 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
