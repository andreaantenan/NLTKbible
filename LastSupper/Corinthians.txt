011:017 But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.
011:018 For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.
011:019 For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
011:020 When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
011:021 For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.
011:022 What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have?  What shall I tell you?  Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.
011:023 For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
011:024 When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you.  Do this in memory of me."
011:025 In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."
011:026 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
011:027 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
011:028 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
011:029 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.
011:030 For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
011:031 For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.
011:032 But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
011:033 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.
011:034 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment.  The rest I will set in order whenever I come.
